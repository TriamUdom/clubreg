# Triam Udom Club registration system

This is the source code of the original club registration system used in Triam Udom Suksa School around 2016 (Thai academic year 2558 - 2559 BE).

Please note that this codebase (which was created to serve our needs back in ~2016) is no longer actively maintained or used, a bit of a mess, and released primarily for historical purposes. Many best practices at the time weren't followed.

## Why are we opensourcing this now?

We are opensourcing this project because on the 2nd of Febuary 2020 AD, github will take a snapshot of every public repositories and archieve them in the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

We hope that our code now will inspire future generations to build upon our works. And may this code, with all of its bugs and reatures, survives long after our departure from this world.

We hope that, in a thousand years, this code is as useful to you as it is to us now.

P.S. If you're reading this from a thousand years for now, Hello World!
